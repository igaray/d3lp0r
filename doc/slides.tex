\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{block}{}
In the context of the Multi-Agent Programming Contest 2011, organized by the Clausthal University of
 Technology, we developed a multi-agent system. It's based on the BDI architecture, and uses \textbf{Argumentation} (via Defeasible Logic Programming) in the decision making process.

\frametitle{The scenario}

\begin{block}{Story}
In the year 2033, humans are surviving in the surface of \textbf{Mars}. They 
depend of their robots to gather water supplies. Sadly, this results in sabotage among different groups of settlers.
\end{block}
\pause

The surface of Mars is represented with an \textbf{undirected graph}, in which 
nodes are valid agent locations weighted by value, and edges are valid
transitions weighted by cost. 
\pause

The goal is to maximize the score function each step. A team is awarded
points according to the value of the nodes controlled by the team, and
in addition certain \textit{achievements}.

\frametitle{Agent roles}
Agent state includes energy, health, and strength parameters. Agent percepts
include visible nodes, edges, and other agents. 
Each agent is assigned a role in the simulation:

\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item Explorer
\item Repairer
\item Sentinel 
\item Saboteur
\item Inspector
\end{itemize} 
\pause

They determine their valid actions and
initial maximum values for the agent state parameters. 

\end{frame}

\section{Design}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Our approach}
The solution follows a decentralised architecture in which agents run 
completely decoupled in different processes while sharing nothing. Percepts 
are communicated among agent members of the team via a broadcast mechanism 
developed as part of the multi-agent system. This design was chosen for its 
minimal complexity.
