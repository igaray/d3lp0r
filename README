    which configures the agent interpreter to start two teams with one explorer 
    agent each.
massim: the original massim server jar files
massim-netbeans: a folder containing a netbeans project with the code for the 
    massim server, with some small modifications. 
    The massim-netbeans/AgentContest/save folder contains the modified scripts 
    necessary to run the server, and also contain a modified xml file named 
    my2011-conf1.xml to configure the server for a single match between two 
    teams with one explorer agent each.
    A copy of this file is also located in the original server's conf directory.
    Instructions: 
        import into netbeans, 
        create a library in library manager called AgentContest
